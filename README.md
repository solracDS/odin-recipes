# odin-recipes

In this project I will build a simple website connected to different recipes. I am training my muscle memory on HTML and Git.

Lessons from the mini-project: I rushed into developing the websites and forgot about commit. Then I commit the full project at once. I ought to use atomic commits, e.g. once the first website is build, commit. Same for the second recipe. 
Overall, I felt strong in html as far as we have gone in the course. In terms of git, despite not following atomic commits, I have the ideas and basic in mind. Looking forward for the next Odin Projects!
