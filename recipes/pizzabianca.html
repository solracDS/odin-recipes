    <h4>The pizza Bianca Gorgonzola is the yummy of the salty-yummies!</h4>
    <p>The pizza Bianca Gorgonzola is an italian-style recipe (specifically, from Napoli). Thin in the center, thicker and crispy in the borders. Ricotta with lemon base, and an extra touch from a D.O.P Grogonzola.
        You can bake it alone, but we recommend doing it with your kids. You (they) will enjoy it (a lot!), and develop new neuron connections (so do you, I hope hehe). &#128513;</p>
